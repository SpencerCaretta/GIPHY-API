# GIPHY-API

The point of this exercise is to be able to push an array of strings to the html as buttons.   The buttons are used to interact with GIPHY API in order to grab 10 GIFs of the designated search time.  The user is able to search a new term and append a button to the screen,  This new button also interacts with the GIPHY API to grab GIFs.  Additional functionality is to make the GIFs still upon clicking them.
